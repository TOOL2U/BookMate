Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for reviewing BookMate. I would like to address the issues identified and clarify that **BookMate is designed for the general public**, not a specific business or organization.

### Regarding Guideline 2.1 - App Completeness

I have identified and resolved the launch error. The issue was related to database connectivity that has now been fixed. The app now includes:

- Proper error handling for network connectivity issues
- Graceful fallback when offline
- Improved stability on iPad devices

I have tested the new build (1.0.2) on:
- iPad Pro 11-inch simulator
- iPad Pro 12.9-inch simulator  
- Multiple iOS/iPadOS versions

The app now launches successfully without errors.

### Regarding Guideline 2.3.3 - Accurate Metadata

I have replaced all iPad screenshots with new, native iPad screenshots that accurately represent the app's UI on iPad devices. The screenshots now show:

- Actual iPad layout (not stretched iPhone images)
- Both portrait and landscape orientations
- The app's core functionality on iPad

### Summary

BookMate is a **general public financial management tool** for rental property owners, similar to other productivity and financial apps available on the App Store (e.g., Mint, YNAB, QuickBooks). We serve the broad market of property managers, not a specific company or limited group.

The new build (1.0.2) addresses all technical and metadata issues identified in the review.

Thank you for your reconsideration. Please let me know if you need any additional information.
